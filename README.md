This is a Facebook clone created using ReactJS (with hooks) and Firebase (as the backend database).

You can access a deployed version over here: https://facebook-clone-a7e16.web.app/

## Technology Stack:
- ReactJS (with React Hooks)
- Firebase real-time database
- Firebase Hosting
- Firebase Google Authentication (Full login)

## How to run on your local machine
1. Clone repository
2. Install dependencies ("npm install")
3. Run "npm start"
4. A tab should pop up in your browser after it's been deployed (Hosted on: http://localhost:3000/)
